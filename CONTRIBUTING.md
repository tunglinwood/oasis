### Contributing to Code Reviews üîç

This part outlines the guidelines and best practices for conducting code reviews in OASIS. The aim is to ensure that all contributions are of high quality, align with the project's goals, and are consistent with our coding standards.

#### Purpose of Code Reviews

- Maintain Code Quality: Ensure that the codebase remains clean, readable, and maintainable.
- Knowledge Sharing: Facilitate knowledge sharing among contributors and help new contributors learn best practices.
- Bug Prevention: Catch potential bugs and issues before they are merged into the main branch.
- Consistency: Ensure consistency in style, design patterns, and architecture across the project.

#### Review Process Overview

- Reviewers should check the code for functionality, readability, consistency, and compliance with the project‚Äôs coding standards.
- If changes are necessary, the reviewer should leave constructive feedback.
- The contributor addresses feedback and updates the PR.
- The reviewer re-reviews the updated code.
- Once the code is approved by at least one reviewer, it can be merged into the main branch.
- Merging should be done by a maintainer or an authorized contributor.

#### Code Review Checklist

- Functionality

  - Correctness: Does the code perform the intended task? Are edge cases handled?
  - Testing: Is there sufficient test coverage? Do all tests pass?
  - Security: Are there any security vulnerabilities introduced by the change?
  - Performance: Does the code introduce any performance regressions?

- Code Quality

  - Readability: Is the code easy to read and understand? Is it well-commented where necessary?
  - Maintainability: Is the code structured in a way that makes future changes easy?
  - Style: Does the code follow the project‚Äôs style guidelines?
    Currently we use Ruff for format check and take [Google Python Style Guide](%22https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html%22) as reference.
  - Documentation: Are public methods, classes, and any complex logic well-documented?

- Design

  - Consistency: Does the code follow established design patterns and project architecture?
  - Modularity: Are the changes modular and self-contained? Does the code avoid unnecessary duplication?
  - Dependencies: Are dependencies minimized and used appropriately?

#### Reviewer Responsibilities

- Timely Reviews: Reviewers should strive to review PRs promptly to keep the project moving.
- Constructive Feedback: Provide feedback that is clear, constructive, and aimed at helping the contributor improve.
- Collaboration: Work with the contributor to address any issues and ensure the final code meets the project‚Äôs standards.
- Approvals: Only approve code that you are confident meets all the necessary criteria.

#### Common Pitfalls

- Large PRs: Avoid submitting PRs that are too large. Break down your changes into smaller, manageable PRs if possible.
- Ignoring Feedback: Address all feedback provided by reviewers, even if you don‚Äôt agree with it‚Äîdiscuss it instead of ignoring it.
- Rushed Reviews: Avoid rushing through reviews. Taking the time to thoroughly review code is critical to maintaining quality.

Code reviews are an essential part of maintaining the quality and integrity of our open source project. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that OASIS remains robust, secure, and easy to maintain, while also fostering a collaborative and welcoming community.

### Guideline for Writing Docstrings

This guideline will help you write clear, concise, and structured docstrings for contributing to `OASIS`.

#### 1. Use the Triple-Quoted String with `r"""` (Raw String)

Begin the docstring with `r"""` to indicate a raw docstring. This prevents any issues with special characters and ensures consistent formatting.

#### 2. Provide a Brief Class or Method Description

- Start with a concise summary of the purpose and functionality.
- Keep each line under `79` characters.
- The summary should start on the first line without a linebreak.

Example:

```python
r"""Class for managing conversations of OASIS Agents.
"""
```

#### 3. Document Parameters in the Args Section

- Use an `Args`: section for documenting constructor or function parameters.
- Maintain the `79`-character limit for each line, and indent continuation lines by 4 spaces.
- Follow this structure:
  - Parameter Name: Match the function signature.
  - Type: Include the type (e.g., `int`, `str`, custom types like `BaseModelBackend`).
  - Description: Provide a brief explanation of the parameter's role.
  - Default Value: Use (`default: :obj:<default_value>`) to indicate default values.

Example:

```markdown
Args:
    system_message (BaseMessage): The system message for initializing
        the agent's conversation context.
    model (BaseModelBackend, optional): The model backend to use for
        response generation. Defaults to :obj:`OpenAIModel` with
        `GPT_4O_MINI`. (default: :obj:`OpenAIModel` with `GPT_4O_MINI`)
```

### Principles üõ°Ô∏è

#### Naming Principle: Avoid Abbreviations in Naming

- Abbreviations can lead to ambiguity, especially since variable names and code in OASIS are directly used by agents.
- Use clear, descriptive names that convey meaning without requiring additional explanation. This improves both human readability and the agent's ability to interpret the code.

Examples:

- Bad: msg_win_sz
- Good: message_window_size

By adhering to this principle, we ensure that OASIS remains accessible and unambiguous for both developers and AI agents.

#### Logging Principle: Use `logger` Instead of `print`

Avoid using `print` for output. Use Python's `logging` module (`logger`) to ensure consistent, configurable, and professional logging.

Examples:

- Bad:
  ```python
  print("Process started")
  print(f"User input: {user_input}")
  ```
- Good:
  ```python
  Args:
  logger.info("Process started")
  logger.debug(f"User input: {user_input}")
  ```

### Board Item Create Workflow üõ†Ô∏è

At OASIS, we manage our project through a structured workflow that ensures efficiency and clarity in our development process. Our workflow includes stages for issue creation and pull requests (PRs), sprint planning, and reviews.

#### Issue Item Stage:

Our [issues](https://github.com/camel-ai/oasis/issues) page on GitHub is regularly updated with bugs, improvements, and feature requests. We have a handy set of labels to help you sort through and find issues that interest you. Feel free to use these labels to keep things organized.

When you start working on an issue, please assign it to yourself so that others know it's being taken care of. If you're unable to assign it to yourself because you're not an OASIS collaborator, feel free to leave a comment on the issue instead.

When creating a new issue, it's best to keep it focused on a specific bug, improvement, or feature. If two issues are related or blocking each other, it's better to link them instead of merging them into one.

We do our best to keep these issues up to date, but considering the fast-paced nature of this field, some may become outdated. If you come across any such issues, please give us a heads-up so we can address them promptly. üëÄ

Here‚Äôs how to engage with our issues effectively:

- Go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/camel-ai/oasis/issues), create a new issue, choose the category, and fill in the required information.
- Ensure the issue has a proper title and update the Assignees, Labels, Projects (select Backlog status), Development, and Milestones.
- Discuss the issue during team meetings, then move it to the Analysis Done column.
- At the beginning of each sprint, share the analyzed issue and move it to the Sprint Planned column if you are going to work on this issue in the sprint.

#### Pull Request Item Stage:

- Go to [GitHub Pulls](https://github.com/camel-ai/oasis/pulls), create a new PR, choose the branch, and fill in the information, linking the related issue.
- Ensure the PR has a proper title and update the Reviewers (convert to draft), Assignees, Labels, Projects (select Developing status), Development, and Milestones.
- If the PR is related to a roadmap, link the roadmap to the PR.
- Move the PR item through the stages: Developing, Stuck, Reviewing (click ready for review), Merged. The linked issue will close automatically when the PR is merged.

**Labeling PRs:**

- **feat**: For new features (e.g., `feat: Add new AI model`)
- **fix**: For bug fixes (e.g., `fix: Resolve memory leak issue`)
- **docs**: For documentation updates (e.g., `docs: Update contribution guidelines`)
- **style**: For code style changes (e.g., `style: Refactor code formatting`)
- **refactor**: For code refactoring (e.g., `refactor: Optimize data processing`)
- **test**: For adding or updating tests (e.g., `test: Add unit tests for new feature`)
- **chore**: For maintenance tasks (e.g., `chore: Update dependencies`)

### Sprint Planning & Review üéØ

#### Definition

Sprint planning defines what can be delivered in the sprint and how it will be achieved. Sprint review allows stakeholders to review and provide feedback on recent work.

#### Practice

- **Sprint Duration**: Four weeks for development and review.
- **Sprint Planning & Review**: Conducted biweekly during the dev meeting (around 30 minutes).
- **Planning**: Founder highlights the sprint goal and key points; developers pick items for the sprint.
- **Review**: Feedback on delivered features and identification of improvement areas.

### Getting Help üÜò

Our aim is to make the developer setup as straightforward as possible. If you encounter any challenges during the setup process, don't hesitate to reach out to a maintainer. We're here to assist you and ensure that the experience is smooth not just for you but also for future contributors. üòä

In line with this, we do have specific guidelines for code linting, formatting, and documentation in the codebase. If you find these requirements difficult or even just bothersome to work with, please feel free to get in touch with a maintainer ‚Äî you can *@doudou_wu in Discord or @Âº†ÂÜçÊñå in the WeChat group*. We don't want these guidelines to hinder the integration of good code into the codebase, so we're more than happy to provide support and find a solution that works for you. ü§ù

## Quick Start üöÄ

To get started with OASIS, follow these steps:

```sh
# Clone github repo
git clone https://github.com/camel-ai/oasis.git

# Change directory into project directory
cd oasis

# Activate oasis virtual environment
poetry shell

# Install oasis from source
poetry install

# The following command installs a pre-commit hook into the local git repo,
# so every commit gets auto-formatted and linted.
pre-commit install

# Run oasis's pre-commit before push
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run oasis's unit tests
pytest test

# Exit the virtual environment
exit
```

These commands will install all the necessary dependencies for running the package, examples, linting, formatting, tests, and coverage.

To verify that everything is set up correctly, run `pytest .` This will ensure that all tests pass successfully. ‚úÖ

> \[!TIP\]
> You need to config OPENAI API Keys as environment variables to pass all tests.

## Generating User Profiles with CLI Arguments üßë‚Äçüíº

OASIS now supports command-line interface (CLI) arguments for generating user profiles in both simple and detailed modes. The following arguments are available:

### User Profile Generation Scripts

Two scripts are available for generating synthetic user profiles:

1. **Simple Profile Generator** (`generator/reddit/user_generate.py`): Creates basic user profiles with fundamental demographic and personality information
2. **Detailed Profile Generator** (`generator/reddit/user_generate_detailed.py`): Creates comprehensive user profiles with extensive demographic, socioeconomic, and psychological attributes
3. **Unified Generator** (`generator/reddit/generate_users.py`): A convenient wrapper to run either simple or detailed generation with a single command

### CLI Arguments

The scripts support the following arguments:

- `--openai-api-key`: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `--openai-base-url`: Custom OpenAI base URL (optional)
- `--model-name`: Model name to use (optional, defaults to "gpt-3.5-turbo")
- `--max-workers`: Maximum number of worker threads (optional, defaults to 100)
- `--N-of-agents`: Number of user profiles to generate (optional, defaults to 10000)
- `--output-path`: Output file path (optional, defaults vary by mode)

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Generate simple profiles with specific parameters
python generator/reddit/user_generate.py \
  --openai-api-key sk-your-api-key-here \
  --model-name gpt-4 \
  --N-of-agents 5000 \
  --output-path ./results/simple_users_5000.json \
  --max-workers 50

# Generate detailed profiles
python generator/reddit/user_generate_detailed.py \
  --openai-api-key sk-your-api-key-here \
  --model-name gpt-4 \
  --N-of-agents 3000 \
  --output-path ./results/detailed_users_3000.json \
  --max-workers 75

# Use the unified generator (recommended)
# Generate simple profiles
python generator/reddit/generate_users.py simple \
  --openai-api-key sk-your-api-key-here \
  --N-of-agents 2000 \
  --model-name gpt-4

# Generate detailed profiles
python generator/reddit/generate_users.py detailed \
  --openai-api-key sk-your-api-key-here \
  --N-of-agents 1000 \
  --output-path ./results/my_detailed_users.json \
  --max-workers 50
```

For comprehensive information on all available options and generated data attributes, see the user generation guide in `docs/user_generation_guide.md`.

## Common Actions üîÑ

### Update dependencies

Whenever you add, update, or delete any dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, please run `poetry lock` to synchronize the dependencies with the lock file.

### Coverage üìä

Code coverage measures the extent to which unit tests cover the code, helping identify both robust and less robust areas of the codebase.

To generate a report showing the current code coverage, execute one of the following commands.

To include all source files into coverage:

```bash
coverage erase
coverage run --source=. -m pytest .
coverage html
# Open htmlcov/index.html
```

To include only tested files:

```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report=html
```

The coverage report will be generated at `htmlcov/index.html`.

### Tests üß™

Currently, the test setup requires an OpenAI API key to test the framework, making them resemble integration tests.

- For Bash shell (Linux, macOS, Git Bash on Windows):\*\*

```bash
# Export your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<insert your OpenAI API key>
```

- For Windows Command Prompt:\*\*

```cmd
REM export your OpenAI API key
set OPENAI_API_KEY=<insert your OpenAI API key>
```

To run all tests including those that use OpenAI API, use the following command:

```bash
pytest .
```
